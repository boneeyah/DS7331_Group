    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset we chose is from insideairbnb.com, which compiles data from Airbnb to highlight the impact of the company on local housing markets in an attempt to expose wastefulness. They reject the claim that Airbnb is solely \"disrupting\" the hotel industry, but that it negatively affects housing costs. It is currently limited to several major cites across the globe, including Los Angelos, where our focus lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of focusing on the wastefulness of Airbnb, we will instead focus our study on business opportunity modeling for Airbnb rentals in the Los Angeles area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Los Angeles as our city of study to focus on one major housing market, our goal is to build a prediction model that predicts daily rental listing price using an error metric, adjusted r^2 to measure its effectiveness. Measuring house space waste from Airbnb, while interesting, would be an arduous task and difficult to prove for the scope of our class. What is useful about this dataset is that it can be ubiquitous for many uses beyond the authors' intended purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price**\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to predict listing price based on the attributes we've identified as valuable, we intend to use 10 Fold Cross Validation, which entails splitting the data into training and test data sets.  The training data set is then split into 10 folds, or smaller sets of the training data.  A model would then be trained on ***k*** - 1 of the sets (9 in our 10 fold case) and the resultant model would be validated on that remaining 10th set of data by calculating our performance metric, adjusted r^2 for the pricing regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process repeats a specified number of times and the average of the performance measure is used to determine the final performance metric of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our model has been tuned using 10-fold CV, we can then use our model to predict the price of data in the original held back test dataset and calculate adjusted r^2 for the actual and predicted price. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Superhost**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the property host's perspective, belonging to AirBNB's super host program provides a confidence boost to tenants knowing that the host of the property they've booked is responsive to questions, has high user reviews, and typically cares about their properties.  With a required rating of 4.8+ over the prior year and less than 1% cancellation rate, AirBNB elevates these hosts as the best of the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a tenant standpoint, booking with a Superhost implies that your host not only cares about the property and your enjoyment, but takes pride in making sure that your stay is excellent and worthy of a high user rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "For active and potential hosts, our goal is to develop a model which can predict whether a property is likely to be hosted by a Superhost.  This could help hosts refine the listings and their own behavior to elevate their status as a Superhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We again will use 10-Fold Cross Validation to train a model on recursive subsets of the training split of data with a single fold held back to score the current iteration, then averaging performance across the runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When our model is complete, we will measure the effectiveness by running our model against the originally held back test data set and calculating an F1 Score.  The F1 score takes into account precision and recall.  Recall is important because we do want to minimize false negatives (predicting a negative response when the opposite is true).  Overly estimating the false negatives could cause hosts to see Superhost status as unattainable or expensive, driving them away.  Precision is also important because we don't want to have a high instance of false positives (predicting a positive response when the true value is negative) which may prolong a hosts time until they become a Superhost by misleading them into thinking they are on the right path.  \"I have great reviews and am well on my way to Superhost!  I don't need to improve!  Tenants love my properties!\"  This could give a false sense of their future status.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score is a good overall performance metric to data sets such as ours, by giving equal weight and importance to both precision and recall.  It will be the best metric to measure how effective our model is for hosts."

Principal Component 1 explains over 51% of the variance in the data, however, including components 1 through 4 would explain over 88% of the variance, reducing our number of dimensions from 7 to 4 while losing inference on the original features of our dataset."
